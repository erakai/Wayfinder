# Wayfinder

Wayfinder allows anyone to access a forum full of google maps based itineraries for any location around the planet. These posts are able to be liked and disliked in order to be sorted. A robust editor allows users to create maps linked to their account, add custom markers with information to various places, set the center and description, and then share it with a URL.

This project was developed for the 36-hour hackathon Boilermake 2022. You can view the submission post [here](https://devpost.com/software/wayfinder-350vyd).
